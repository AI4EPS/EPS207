# Welcome to [EPS207 Observational Seismology](https://ai4eps.github.io/EPS207_Observational_Seismology/)

Seismology is the study of earthquakes and seismic waves that traverse the Earth. We can extract rich information from seismic waveform to study earthquake sources, Earth's interior structure, and other processes such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, and glacier movements. Seismology also has many engineering applications such as oil/gas/geothermal energy exploration, natural/induced earthquake monitoring, and earthquake early warning.
In this course, we will learn many data processing and machine learning techniques to analyze seismic waveforms and extract useful information.

The class will be a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises. We will use primarily Python (obpsy, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pytorch, etc.) and some Julia as programming languages. The course is designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. No prior knowledge of seismology is required.
